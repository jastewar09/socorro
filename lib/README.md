This directory contains libraries that need to be linked to when
building Socorro.

The library itself must be installed and/or built first, so that
the appropriate library files exist for Socorro to link against.

Each library directory contains a README with additional info about
how to acquire and/or build the library.

The libraries in this directory are the following:

fftmpi        URL: https://fftmpi.sandia.gov/index.html
