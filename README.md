## What is Socorro?

Socorro is a plane-wave density functional theory code for solid-state electronic structure calculations. It is a modular, object-oriented code for performing self-consistent and time-dependent electronic-structure calculations utilizing the Kohn-Sham formulation of density functional theory. Calculations are performed using a plane-wave basis and norm-conserving pseudopotentials, ultra-soft pseudopotentials, or projector augmented-wave functions. Several exchange-correlation functionals are available for use, including the local-density approximation and the generalized-gradient approximation. Both Fourier-space and real-space projectors are implemented, and a variety of methods are available for relaxing atom positions, optimizing cell parameters, finding transition states, and performing molecular dynamics calculations (Born-Oppenheimer, Car-Parinello, and Ehrenfest dynamics).

## Development:

Socorro was developed under the auspices of the Accelerated Strategic Computing Intiative at Sandia National Laboratories.
