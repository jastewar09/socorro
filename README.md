## What is Socorro?

Socorro is a plane-wave density functional theory code for solid-state electronic structure calculations.

## Availability:

The official Socorro release and related information can be found on this website: 'https://dft.sandia.gov/'

## Notice:

This GitHub repo is my "fork" of Socorro for messing around with git, make, cmake, and other coding/library fun.
